Steps to do:
1. Change Bot Token if you want to use your own Bot - Go to config.json

2. Change the default prefix in misc.json if you want to.

3. Go to lavalink-server.json and replace localhost with your server IP Address, I believe that's how it works for VPS.

Run the Bot:
1. Make sure you have Java 11, not newer, not older. Get Java 11, it runs the best for me during testing.
2. Open Terminal and since you already have Java, run java -jar Lavalink.jar
3. Open a New Terminal, do node . OR npm start to run the bot. It will show that it is connecting to the Lavalink server. Soon, everything should be working perfectly
